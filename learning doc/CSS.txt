CSS selectors:-
element
class(start with ".")
id(start with "#")

Eg- <style>
__     ,.__ , #__ { 
                    declarations: value;
                  }                  
    </style>

COMBINE SELECTOR:-
element with clss selector(selector.class)
child(direct) selector[selector > selector]
descendent seloctor[seloctor selector]

pseudo-class selector:-
selector:pseudo-class{}-:link,:visited,:hover,:active,:nth-child

style placement:-
 external style placement:-
  <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
 internal style placement:-
 <p,div,h1... style="declarations:value;">hello world</p,/div,/h1...>

 Conflict resoultion:-
  origin precedencr:-
   last declarations wins because html processed from top to bottom.
  declarations merge:-
   So a declaration for, for example, font size, and a declaration for color
   since they're two different properties, when they're targeted to the same element
   even if they're targeted from two different origins, they will merge into one.
